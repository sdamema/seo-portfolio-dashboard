        title: "Why the project was created",
        body: `<p>The initial problem was a <strong>SERP quality gap</strong>. For several supplier-review queries, generic editorial pages were not always the most convincing result. Often, both for us and for competitors, <strong>Reddit threads, public Facebook discussions or community posts</strong> appeared more aligned with what users were actually looking for: real experiences, complaints, doubts and concrete details.</p><p>The SEO reasoning was that Google was rewarding content with stronger <strong>human evidence</strong>. A normal supplier description could explain tariffs and company facts, but it did not necessarily answer the emotional and practical question behind the query: "What do real customers say?" It could also feel less authentic if every opinion was written directly by us, without an external evidence layer.</p><p>So the page format was redesigned around <strong>collected customer language</strong>. Instead of inventing opinions or writing a purely generic review, the content uses real comments as the evidence layer and turns them into a structured page that can be read, compared and audited.</p>`

        title: "How the scoring and analysis worked",
        body: `<p>The score was designed as a <strong>weighted interpretation</strong>, not as a simple average of random comments. Each provider could have different source coverage and comment quality, so the same method had to balance <strong>sentiment, specificity, recency, reliability, cluster distribution</strong> and a small statistical correction for thin datasets.</p><div class="formula-accordion formula-single"><details open><summary><span>Full scoring formula and statistical logic</span></summary><div class="formula-grid"><article><span>1. Sentiment signal</span><p>Each valid comment received <strong>s_i</strong>, a sentiment score from <strong>-1 to +1</strong>. The key rule is that sentiment is measured toward the supplier being reviewed, not toward a competitor, the energy market in general or a confusing external situation.</p></article><article><span>2. Comment quality</span><p>The formula then uses <strong>q_i</strong> to reward comments that are more useful: direct experience, concrete details, a clear outcome and decision value. A detailed billing issue or switching experience therefore matters more than a vague "good" or "bad" opinion.</p></article><article><span>3. Recency factor</span><p><strong>r_i</strong> gives more weight to recent comments, because supplier service, app quality, prices and support can change over time. Missing dates are handled conservatively instead of being guessed from weak clues.</p></article><article><span>4. Comment weight</span><p>The final comment weight is <strong>w_i = 0.35 + 0.45*q_i + 0.20*r_i</strong>. Statistically, this keeps every approved comment in the calculation, but lets <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>freshness</strong> decide how much influence it has.</p></article><article><span>5. Cluster score</span><p>For each topic cluster, the method calculates <strong>mu_k = sum(w_i*s_i) / sum(w_i)</strong>. In practice this means every cluster score is a weighted sentiment average, not a simple count of positive and negative comments.</p></article><article><span>6. Robustness correction</span><p>The correction <strong>lambda_k = n_k / (n_k + 10)</strong> prevents a small cluster from moving too aggressively. With few comments, the score stays closer to a central baseline; with more comments, the observed user signal counts more.</p></article><article><span>7. Overall score</span><p>The final score combines the five cluster scores with fixed weights: <strong>Tariffs 0.30</strong>, <strong>Support 0.30</strong>, <strong>App/Billing 0.15</strong>, <strong>Activation 0.15</strong> and <strong>Reputation 0.10</strong>. Stable weights make supplier comparisons fair.</p></article><article><span>8. QA safeguards</span><p>Excluded comments are removed before scoring, not treated as neutral. Each included row needs a valid cluster, sentiment reason, quality score and recency value, so the final number can be traced back to the evidence.</p></article></div></details></div><p>Positive comments were also separated by theme, because a supplier can be appreciated for <strong>price</strong> but criticized for <strong>support</strong>, or the opposite. The goal was an explainable editorial score: users see the final number, but they can also understand <strong>which clusters influenced it</strong> and why the supplier is perceived that way.</p>`
