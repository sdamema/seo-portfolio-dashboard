        body: `<p>The initial problem was a <strong>SERP quality gap</strong>. For several supplier-review queries, generic editorial pages were not always the most convincing result. Often, both for us and for competitors, <strong>Reddit threads, public Facebook discussions or community posts</strong> appeared more aligned with what users were actually looking for: real experiences, complaints, doubts and concrete details.</p><p>The SEO reasoning was that Google was rewarding content with stronger <strong>human evidence</strong>. A normal supplier description could explain tariffs and company facts, but it did not necessarily answer the emotional and practical question behind the query: "What do real customers say?" It could also feel less authentic if every opinion was written directly by us, without an external evidence layer.</p><p>So the page format was redesigned around <strong>collected customer language</strong>. Instead of inventing opinions or writing a purely generic review, the content uses real comments as the evidence layer and turns them into a structured page that can be read, compared and audited.</p>`

Each provider could have different source coverage and comment quality, so the same method had to balance <strong>sentiment, specificity, recency, reliability, cluster distribution</strong> and a small statistical correction for thin datasets.</p><div class="formula-accordion formula-single"><details open><summary><span>Full scoring formula and statistical logic</span></summary><div class="formula-grid"><article><span>1. Sentiment signal</span><p>Each valid comment received <strong>s_i</strong>, a sentiment score from <strong>-1 to +1</strong>. The key rule is that sentiment is measured toward the supplier being reviewed, not toward a competitor, the energy market in general or a confusing external situation.</p></article><article><span>2. Comment quality</span><p>The formula then uses <strong>q_i</strong> to reward comments that are more useful: direct experience, concrete details, a clear outcome and decision value. A detailed billing issue or switching experience therefore matters more than a vague "good" or "bad" opinion.</p></article><article><span>3. Recency factor</span><p><strong>r_i</strong> gives more weight to recent comments, because supplier service, app quality, prices and support can change over time. Missing dates are handled conservatively instead of being guessed from weak clues.</p></article><article><span>4. Comment weight</span><p>The final comment weight is <strong>w_i = 0.35 + 0.45*q_i + 0.20*r_i</strong>. Statistically, this keeps every approved comment in the calculation, but lets <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>freshness</strong> decide how much influence it has.</p></article><article><span>5. Cluster score</span><p>For each topic cluster, the method calculates <strong>mu_k = sum(w_i*s_i) / sum(w_i)</strong>. In practice this means every cluster score is a weighted sentiment average, not a simple count of positive and negative comments.</p></article><article><span>6. Robustness correction</span><p>The correction <strong>lambda_k = n_k / (n_k + 10)</strong> prevents a small cluster from moving too aggressively. With few comments, the score stays closer to a central baseline; with more comments, the observed user signal counts more.</p></article><article><span>7. Overall score</span><p>The final score combines the five cluster scores with fixed weights: <strong>Tariffs 0.30</strong>, <strong>Support 0.30</strong>, <strong>App/Billing 0.15</strong>, <strong>Activation 0.15</strong> and <strong>Reputation 0.10</strong>. Stable weights make supplier comparisons fair.</p></article><article><span>8. QA safeguards</span><p>Excluded comments are removed before scoring, not treated as neutral. Each included row needs a valid cluster, sentiment reason, quality score and recency value, so the final number can be traced back to the evidence.</p></article></div></details></div><p>Positive comments were also separated by theme, because a supplier can be appreciated for <strong>price</strong> but criticized for <strong>support</strong>, or the opposite. The goal was an explainable editorial score: users see the final number, but they can also understand <strong>which clusters influenced it</strong> and why the supplier is perceived that way.</p>`

It is also <strong>manual review time, cleaning time and discarded data</strong>. A better instruction layer can improve the cost-per-useful-comment because fewer scraped comments need to be deleted later.</p><p>The time-saving estimate was built only on comments that were <strong>on-topic but too generic</strong>: comments that a naive filter might have kept, but that the quality rules excluded because they lacked concrete detail. It does <strong>not</strong> count obvious spam, emoji, sponsorship noise or off-topic posts that would have been discarded anyway.</p><div class="process-flow process-flow--summary"><article><span>Solid base</span><p><strong>543 usable comments</strong> were delivered across <strong>12 suppliers</strong>, counted as real CSV records rather than inflated line counts.</p></article><article><span>Central estimate</span><p>The quality rules likely avoided reading and evaluating about <strong>815 generic comments</strong>, based on a 1.5x ratio against the useful final comments.</p></article><article><span>Time model</span><p>At roughly <strong>20 seconds per comment</strong> for reading and deciding if it was usable, that equals about <strong>4.5 hours saved</strong>.</p></article><article><span>Scaling</span><p>The average is around <strong>23 minutes saved per supplier</strong>; applying the same method to 20-30 suppliers would scale toward a full working day or more.</p></article></div><p>This is especially relevant for social sources.

The analysis had to connect <strong>Search Console visibility</strong> with business metrics such as <strong>PP, clients, TR, CM3 and CM3/PP</strong>, plus technical signals like <strong>crawl status, indexability and noindex pages</strong>. The question became: which URLs are visible, which URLs create value, and where is the gap between the two?</p>`

        body: `<p>The work started by bringing different sources into the same reading frame: <strong>Google Search Console exports</strong>, crawl/indexability checks, URL lists and business KPI files.

      },
      {
        title: "What I understood from the data",
        body: `<p>The main insight was that <strong>not all organic activity had the same value</strong>.

That suggested an intent mismatch: the page was capturing a search need, but the conversion path was not always aligned with what the user wanted.</p><p>This was especially relevant for the <strong>sportelli</strong> area. Hub pages could receive local-intent users, but those users were often looking for a physical branch, a city page, an address or local support information. If the page pushed them immediately into a generic commercial action, the result could be <strong>low-quality PP</strong> rather than qualified clients.</p><p>The second insight was technical: some useful pages needed an <strong>indexability review</strong>. A noindex page is not only a technical status; it is a business decision. If a page family has potential search demand and can support the user journey, leaving it out of the index may mean losing qualified visibility.</p>`

A user could search or select a region/city, then move faster toward the relevant local page instead of getting stuck in a generic hub experience.</p><p>The second direction was the <strong>noindex review</strong>. Pages that looked useful from an SEO/business perspective were checked and, where appropriate, brought back into the indexation flow. This turned the analysis into action: not only identifying a technical issue, but deciding which pages deserved to be re-indexed because they could support organic acquisition.</p><p>The final value of the project was prioritization. It helped define where to redesign, where to re-index, where to monitor and where to avoid unnecessary changes. In other words: the output was not a single page, but a clearer decision system for future SEO and business work on the site.</p>`

        body: `<p>My analysis showed a clear mismatch between <strong>visibility</strong> and <strong>business value</strong>. Some branch hub pages were visible in search and generated phone-pickup activity, but they did not consistently become clients. That suggested that the page was not necessarily failing at ranking: it was failing at <strong>guiding the user's intent</strong> after the click.</p><p>The underlying query intent was often local. Users were searching for things like a <strong>branch near them</strong>, a specific city, an address, opening hours or a provider office. On the existing hub structure, they could land on a long list of branches or a region accordion and still need to manually find the right city. On mobile, this means <strong>extra scrolling, extra taps and more friction</strong> before the user reaches the page that actually matches the need.</p><p>The branch map was designed to solve that exact pain point. Instead of treating the hub as a generic landing page, it turns it into a <strong>local-intent router</strong>: the user selects a region or searches a city, then reaches the relevant local page with less friction. The project was not published, but the reasoning is useful because it connects <strong>SEO, UX and business conversion quality</strong>.</p>`
